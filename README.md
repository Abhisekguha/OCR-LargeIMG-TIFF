# OCR Large Document Processing

This project provides an OCR solution for processing large document images, using PaddleOCR integrated with a Gradio-based user interface. It supports text extraction, bounding box annotations, and performance evaluation through Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER).

## Features

- Handles large images by tiling them for OCR processing.
- Extracts texts and numbers with bounding box annotations.
- Saves results to a CSV file.
- Provides WER and CER metrics to compare OCR results with ground truth text.
- Generates visual plots of error rates.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your machine. A virtual environment is recommended for dependency management.

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/OCR-Large-Document-Processing.git
   cd OCR-Large-Document-Processing
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows

Install dependencies: Install all required packages using the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the OCR application: Execute the Python script to launch the Gradio web interface:

python OCR_large-Dimdocs.py
Upload a document:

Upload large images in formats such as .tiff, .png, or .jpg.
Optionally, provide ground truth text to calculate WER and CER.
View Results:

The extracted text and numbers will be displayed in the interface.
Bounding box annotations will be shown on the uploaded image.
Download the OCR results as a CSV file.
Visualize the WER and CER metrics in the form of a bar chart.
Optional: Use Google Vision or Other Annotation Tools
You can use annotation tools like Google Vision to annotate and extract text from images for comparison:

Upload the same document to Google Vision or any other annotation tool.
Compare results:
Compare the text extracted by this project with the ground truth or outputs from Google Vision.
Use the WER and CER metrics generated by the app to evaluate the OCR accuracy.
Evaluation
WER (Word Error Rate): Compares the words extracted by the OCR against the ground truth and calculates the error rate.

CER (Character Error Rate): Measures the character-level error rate between the OCR output and ground truth.

Example Workflow

Upload a .tiff image of size 3400x36400.
Enter optional ground truth text (if available).
Process the image to extract text, numbers, and bounding box annotations.
Save the results to a CSV file.
Compare OCR results with Google Vision or other tools using the WER and CER metrics.
Dependencies
gradio: User interface for the web app.
paddleocr: OCR library for text extraction.
paddlepaddle: Deep learning framework supporting PaddleOCR.
pillow: For image manipulation.
opencv-python: For drawing bounding boxes and annotations.
numpy: Array operations for image processing.
matplotlib: For visualizing error rates.
jiwer: WER and CER computation.
Run the Script

Run the main Python file:

python OCR_large-Dimdocs.py
